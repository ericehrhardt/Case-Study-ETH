Model Formulation 
==================

The model code is divided into four sections. Each code file sets up a portion of the final model. 
Description of all models and variables in the model can be found below.

1. **setup_base.jl**
2. **setup_storage.jl**
3. **setup_transport.jl**
4. **setup_policy.jl**
