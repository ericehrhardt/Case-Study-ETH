Model Coefficients
===================

Each model coefficient is defined through a function that reads the coefficient value from the input data. All coefficient functions have names beginning with capital letters. The code for all of the coefficients is contained in the **coefficients.jl** file.

In this page, we proviide documentation for each of the coefficient functions. The documentation for each coefficient specifies exactly how the coefficient values are calculated from the input data.
